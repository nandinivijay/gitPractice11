What is a Final keyword ?

Java final keyword is a non-access specifier that is used to restrict a class, variable, and method. If we initialize a variable with the final keyword, then we cannot modify its value.

If we declare a method as final, then it cannot be overridden by any subclasses. And, if we declare a class as final, we restrict the other classes to inherit or extend it.

In other words, the final classes can not be inherited by other classes.

Final keyword in Java has three different uses: create constants, prevent inheritance and prevent methods from being overridden.
