Inheritance
Inheritance in Java is a concept that acquires the properties from one class to other classes; for example, the relationship between father and son. 

In Java, a class can inherit attributes and methods from another class. The class that inherits the properties is known as the sub-class or the child class. The class from which the properties are inherited is known as the superclass or the parent class.

Single Inheritace
When a class inherits another class, it is known as a single inheritance.  B class inherits the A class, so there is the single inheritance.

Multilevel Inheritance
When there is a chain of inheritance, it is known as multilevel inheritance. C class inherits the B class which again inherits the A class, so there is a multilevel inheritance.

Hierarchical Inheritance
When two or more classes inherits a single class, it is known as hierarchical inheritance. B  and Cat classes inherits the A class, so there is hierarchical inheritance.
