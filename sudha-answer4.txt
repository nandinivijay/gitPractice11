Cucumber Annotations

@RunWith() annotation tells about the test runner class to start executing our tests.

@CucmberOptions() annotation is used to set some properties for our cucumber test like feature file, step definition, etc.

@Given: given specifies the pre-conditions. It is basically a known state.

@When: This is used when some action is to be performed. 

@Then: The expected outcome or result should be placed here. 

@Before==>This will run before the every scenario.

@After====>This will run after the every scenario.


@Before(order = int) : This runs in increment order, means value 0 would run first and 1 would be after 0.
@After(order = int) : This runs in decrements order, means apposite of @Before. Value 1 would run first and 0 would be after 1.
